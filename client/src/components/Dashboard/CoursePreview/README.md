# Course Preview

This folder contains components that display the preview pane when selecting course elements in the content pane such as the course header, categories and grades and either editing or deleting them.

It also contains some components that are used between them like ItemInline, ItemNormal, ItemVertical.

Due to many of these components being very similar (with the difference being the previewed fields and functions), there may be outdated comments due to copy-pasting here and there. The "template" that was used to build the other components was `GradeEdit.jsx` as it is the most complex.
