# Course Preview

This folder contains components that display the preview pane when selecting non course elements (those are in folder CoursePreview) and offering the ability to add or modify them.

It includes preview components such as adding semesters and courses, editing semesters, and all the account options.

Due to many of these components being very similar (with the difference being the previewed fields and functions), there may be outdated comments due to copy-pasting here and there. The "template" that was used to build the other components was `GradeEdit.jsx` (in CoursePreview) as it is the most complex.
