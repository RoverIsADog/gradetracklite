# Pages

This folder should contain React components that are responsible for rendering entire pages such as the login page or the dashboard. They are the components that React-Router render for each route.

Although they are not conceptually different than the components in `/components`, page-generating components should be put here for organisation's sake.

## Naming convention:

Same as normal components: files names in UpperCamelCase.
