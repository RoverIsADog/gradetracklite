# REST Requests Definitions

This folder contains sample expected requests and sample expected responses for the REST API. It will likely be out of date. The precedence in case of conflicts is:
1. The word document `API Requests.docs` (because easily editable)
2. The contents of this folder
3. The database drawing (it's already very out of date as of today)
