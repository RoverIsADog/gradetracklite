# Workflow

## Main Communication Tool

Our team's main method of communication is through Discord.

The decision to use Discord as our primary communication tool is based on several factors. The main reason for this choice is the familiarity of the platform among all team members, as many of us have used it before, for other projects or for personal communication. This familiarity allows us to quickly make use of the various features that Discord offers to streamline our communication process.

Discord offers an easy-to-use interface for real-time messaging, voice chat, and screen sharing. Furthermore, Discord has a mobile application that allows team members to stay connected and informed even while on the go. Additionally, Discord's feature of creating multiple chats and organizing them into categories makes it easier for us to sort our chats by topic.

Overall, Discord was the optimal choice for our team's communication needs. 

## Meetings

Our team has preset meetings every Tuesday and Thursday after class, where we meet in person to discuss the current workflow, advancements, issues encountered, and more.

We also schedule additional meetings when necessary, such as when encountering big issues that need resolution, or conflict between team members (e.g., which database to use). These meetings can be done in person or on Discord calls.
