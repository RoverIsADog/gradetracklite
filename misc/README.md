# Miscellaneous

## This folder should probably be removed at some point

This folder contains miscellaneous files such as templates, files for testing, changelogs, SQL files...
Its purpose is to vacuum in anything that isn't related to the current source code and keep the `client` and `server` folders clean of rubble.
